",The Bridge Theater,,2015-12-02,BLACK 2,Performances,06/07/1965,"lumagrams, bass, poetry, dance","Black 2 was an attempt to enrich the theatrical experience with the impact of other fields of art.  It is the study of Sound, Light, and Motion.  This performance is believed to be the first attempt to combine the visual arts, dance, music, projections, poetry and various sounds, to affect and involve the audience’s total senses….and sense of social commitment.
	Black 2 is an abstract concept of a social message.  It is not a play, It is not a “Happening”.  It is the fusion of different arts.  It is the bombardment of the senses. I describe it as a “Centerfuge:  
The dimensions of sound, light and motion brought into organic form; the working together of several talents express  the idiom of the contemporary scene; the fusion of abstract and social commitment.
	Black 2 brings together several modalities:  film and projectors, live sound, tape recorders, a dancer, a social poet, a musician, black spaces, live machines, mike techniques a lantern and “lumagrams.”  Lumagrams are what I called my hand painted slides which are used as projected images.

Silver discs were pinned all over the plastic costume so that they would shine and shimmer under the light as the dancer moved.  Her headpiece was designed to move as a mobile. 
 
Aldo created an original set of 160 hand made slides (lumagrams) which were projected from two carousel projectors.  These slides all had a black circle split down the middle leaving a band of light in the center.  The dancer used the black space and the light area to improvise movement in and out of the light.  She also used a big loop to create the image of a circle within a circle. The projectors were hand-held and moved in a circular motion seen on the screen and on the dancer.  At one point a 16mm film, from the “Black Film Series,” added a faster kinetic movement.
